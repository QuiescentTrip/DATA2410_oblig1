## Explain the differences observed in the minimum round-trip time
It's important to state that this experiment was done at home and not at school. This would maybe change the ping time to oslomet.no. However it might not? This is something we can confirm when we do our traceroute. So since we did this at home oslomet minimum time is a lot higher than what I would otherwise expect. Oxford's website has a very low min RTT. I'd expect because their infastructure is deemed as more "important" hence less routes. This again we have to confirm when we do our traceroutes. It can also be that their severs are just faster. Gaia is down? Which is weird 'cause their website is up. Sydney is sloooow which makes sense. We need a lot of hops to reach all the way down to syndey. Not only hops but we're also at the mercy of the speed of light / speed of electicity to send information.
